# In MovieLens_project notebook

In this EDA notebook, I tried to get the distribution of ratings from ratings file.

Kyle Balda, Patty Jenkins, Bill condon etc are popular directors in 2020, 2019.....

And after that tried to get the names of top, 'popular directors' and 'popular production companies'

Universal pictures, Illumination Entertainment, Dune Entertainment, Warner Bros., DC Entertainment are popular production companies...

Then did some anlysis on word counts in titles and tagline and tried Vectorizers and wordcloud

# We are working on text generation and recommender system and for that we have started with some EDA work and then will move on to techniques like text classification.
